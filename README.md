##Tomato Timer

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This project is me recreating the famous tomato timer site using React Hooks. Don't have a lot of experience with hooks and working with them so thought I would try my hand at working through it. 

## Available Scripts 

Use 'npm run start' to start the development server. 


### Features I want to implement
